                  Operation management refers to the administration of
                  organisational practices, which are applied to enhance the
                  overall performance of an organisation. Effective project
                  management ensures successful completion of a project within a
                  specific time and an estimated budget. The operation
                  management of TalkTalk, which operates its services from the
                  UK can be highlighted in this context. The company provides
                  service users with TV, home phone, mobile phone, and broadband
                  services. Before expanding in Africa, the company, which
                  possesses 2288 employees, requires 4Vs or volumes to improve
                  quality of products.

                  TalkTalk uses both the Professional Services, as well as the
                  Mass services depending on the requirements in a specific
                  situation. As opined by Spangenberg and Lorek (2019), it is
                  vital for organisations to consider “volume-variety”, which
                  further considers “professional services”, “service shops” and
                  “mass services”. For instance, the mass services of TalkTalk
                  depend on CSG solutions, an integrated solution to understand
                  the changing requirements of their valuable consumers. On the
                  other hand, considering professional services helps TalkTalk
                  to enter a strategic partnership with more than 800
                  organisations (Talktalkbusiness.co.uk, 2020).

                  Service design describes the process planning of any
                  organisation that operates all functions and activities to
                  improve the quality of the service. Dalcher (2019) stated that
                  service design provides a framework for companies to offer
                  their products and mitigate issues in the service delivery
                  system. TalkTalk offers a range of services that are
                  completely based upon IT services. Additionally, production of
                  service design packages is being identified in TalkTalk. The
                  mobile network service is designed to offer 4G and 2G network
                  services to customers (Talktalkbusiness.co.uk, 2020). The
                  company has targeted indoor and outdoor customers and provides
                  prepaid and post-paid connections. Furthermore, contract-based
                  services provides support for individual businesses such as
                  small, medium, and large businesses. According to the Ideas of
                  Slack and Brandon-Jones (2018), apart from individual services
                  to customers, this company has also engaged in providing
                  services to business organisations. Analysing based on process
                  types the complex type of processes have been identified in
                  the company (Kerzner, 2017). Additionally, service process
                  types are mainly two types. One is professional services and
                  another is Mass services, which are existing currently in the
                  company. Professional Service process types have been designed
                  for business organisations and business partners of TalkTalk.
                  On the other hand, the Mass service process types are designed
                  for common people and services, such as “Internet Access, data
                  networking and voice call” are being offered to people. The
                  company offered 180,000 business and public sector customers
                  with a reliable service (Talktalkbusiness.co.uk, 2020). This
                  is mostly easy-to-use, innovative and provides a great value
                  of connectivity.

                  Setting a clearly defined strategy and objectives for
                  targeting prospective customers are very significant for
                  telecom companies. TalkTalk has its very keen observational
                  customers’ demands. Two types of customers are being offered
                  two different types of services, namely normal and industrial
                  customers (Talktalkbusiness.co.uk, 2020). As influenced by
                  Kerzner (2017), the strategy used by TalkTalk to ensure
                  low-cost price for connections and the internet. Using 4G and
                  2G technologies for domestic customers are also being used for
                  this purpose. To provide a strong business relationship with
                  business partners, “Network Brilliance” programme envisioned
                  to support digital growth of UK based businesses. Business
                  partnerships have taken a new dimension under the new program
                  paradigm by TalkTalk (Slack et al., 2016). <br />{" "}
                  Additionally, this company partnered with the BMC to provide
                  CMDB, a new configuration management database to the business
                  organisations (Talktalkbusiness.co.uk, 2020). Additionally,
                  TalkTalk uses advanced technology. This includes providing
                  better visibility in the business decision-making process. The
                  company also invested in technological advancements and
                  established an information-sharing platform using CMDB that
                  reduced the cost of ownership for this company (Benjaafar and
                  Hu, 2020).

                  CBT focuses on the way consumers make their decisions while
                  purchasing specific products. As per the views of Kreye
                  (2018), the marketers require predicting how the customers
                  will react when they introduce a specific product in a market.
                  For instance, the leaders of TalkTalk take into consideration
                  the physiological, personal, and social characteristics of the
                  target consumers to analyse what determines their purchasing
                  habits (Talktalkbusiness.co.uk, 2020). For instance, they
                  communicate with the service users through online platforms
                  and the company’s website to understand when and how they will
                  purchase their products.

                  Customer expectations are one of the significant
                  considerations for service providers. TalkTalk has several
                  strategies and control measures to follow its service
                  standards and quality of the service networks as well. As per
                  the ideas of Mohammed (2020), under the TQM framework, all the
                  quality control processes can be investigated for TalkTalk.
                  Telecom Company TalkTalk has inducted a new cloud-based system
                  and shifted from the old HR system to improve its service
                  delivery and its quality. <br /> Conformance to accurate
                  information provided to the managers had helped this company
                  in reducing costs in several areas such as salary costs,
                  headcount costs and many more (Hofmann et al., 2020). Higher
                  engagement of skilled labour has been achieved after the
                  successful integration of cloud-based systems. On the other
                  hand, meeting customer expectations are also being achieved by
                  the effective management of the workforce, as stated by the
                  services manager Jackie Wilson (Business Connectivity, 2020).
                  Meeting customer expectations from diverse ranges of services
                  and types of network options such as 4G and 2G connections,
                  fibre internet connections have generated positive results for
                  this company. TalkTalk grew its business and has a customer
                  base of more than 4mn in the UK (Talktalkbusiness.co.uk,
                  2020). <br /> However, improvement strategies, such as
                  acquisition have not been profitable for this company. The
                  difficulty between collaboration with its partners created
                  increasing costs in the business operation process (Dilawo and
                  Salimi, 2019). Other challenges include prototyping and
                  implementing new technologies in their running business
                  framework. Authorisation and managing the recruitment process
                  became a significant point of consideration. TalkTalk scored
                  lower than average meeting customer expectations satisfaction
                  level. Increasing the number of complaints is sufficient to
                  have perspective on the customer satisfaction levels in
                  TalkTalk. Hence, this can be stated that the improvement cycle
                  (PDCA) enabled the evaluation of the difficulty in the quality
                  improvements and quality maintenance processes that are
                  slowing down the improvement for TalkTalk
                  (Talktalkbusiness.co.uk, 2020).

                  Customer satisfaction level and achieving targets in business
                  are being dependent upon the quality of the service and
                  products. According to Akkermans et al. (2020), the Total
                  Quality management framework provides an outline that any
                  organization can use for long-term success. As per the
                  statement of Dilawo and Salimi (2019), the implementation
                  principle of TQM required quality development, Quality
                  maintenance and Quality improvement processes. Quality
                  development in TalkTalk includes its initiatives to use the 4G
                  network of O2, to improve customer experience of faster
                  internet. Quality development can be seen in providing better
                  user experience and partnering with O2, another telecom
                  service provider. <br /> However, as a responsible MVNO
                  (Mobile Virtual Network Operator), TalkTalk quality
                  maintenance is also being achieved by partnering with TCS.
                  About 97% of the population are being covered under the 2G and
                  3G network of TalkTalk. To maintain high-speed internet and
                  data transmission, the 3G connection has maintained a standard
                  of quality that offered sufficient networking speed to
                  customers. On the other hand, 4G connectivity is an
                  underperformer for this company. Variety of 3G data plans such
                  as “sim only plans and data only” plans are still able to
                  manage its customer base. Additionally, no cost roaming in EU
                  and EEA countries also provides benefits such as customer
                  satisfaction level for this company. <br />
                  However, situations have changed due to quality improvement
                  plans. Quality improvements of TalkTalk and its partnering
                  with TCS enabled this company in static testing of its
                  networks. Regularity in a great volume of releases and
                  reduction release time has been achieved by partnering with
                  TCS (Business Connectivity, 2020). Accordingly, the
                  development of systems and procedures have been established by
                  partnering with TCS, and TalkTalk tests its service platform
                  prior to delivering services to customers
                  (Talktalkbusiness.co.uk, 2020). Hence, great control over
                  technologies has been achieved by the company. Other benefits
                  are including a continuous process of improvement in the
                  company. As per the comments of Mohammed (2020), TalkTalk
                  became able to design, build, test and operate its consumer
                  division with the help of TCS. Great competitive advantages
                  have been identified in this process with an increasing number
                  of customer satisfaction levels.

                  Management of projects depicts the activities that are
                  necessary to shape a complete project and measure its success
                  as per the defined organisational objectives. TalkTalk and its
                  partnership with TCS allowed in designing its relevant
                  technologies which are essential for maintaining the
                  continuous standard of the network. Hence, the quality, time
                  of delivering technology have been achieved through the
                  partnership. On the other hand, the company’s partnership with
                  O2 in the UK has provided delivering the 4G network to its
                  customers. According to Mohammed (2020), the service standard
                  was relatively poor in comparison with its competitors.
                  Improving 4G services become an utter necessity for the
                  company. Hence, managing life cycle and performance objectives
                  have partially been met and required to improve its 4G
                  services in the UK. Additionally, being up-to-date is
                  essential for a business, whereas, improving 4G services can
                  generate greater profits for this company for long-term
                  (Mohammed, 2020). However, as per the 4Vs analysis, for
                  improving its performance related to customer satisfaction
                  level, the Company has offered ranges of different plans to
                  ranges of customers. Such plans include homeworking packages
                  for fibre-based internet connection like WAN with higher speed
                  up to 1GB/Sec (Business Connectivity, 2020).

                        which offers internet and other facilities within Cairo.
                        Hence, TalkTalk, in this case, is needed to lower their
                        expenditure so that they can provide the services at a

                          From above discussions, it can be concluded that there

                          operation management process of TalkTalk. Firstly,
                          poor quality of services has been identified to cause
                          issues, such as poor customer satisfaction and poor
                          adaptability to advanced technology. However, recent
                          changes, such as partnering with tech companies, and
                          adapting cloud-based systems have delivered positive
                          results to the company. Technology development and
                          testing facilities have been achieved that helped this
                          company to improve its quality of network services.

                          domestic and industrial users. This strategic plan
                          helps to maintain and sustain its business profits and
                          the company is required to establish its own 4G
                          network to help its future expansion project in Cairo,
