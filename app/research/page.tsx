                  The topic will deal with the importance of Ratio analysis in
                  an organization. Ratio analysis is a viable tool that helps in
                  determining the basis of the financial management techniques
                  to be used in the organization. The importance of ratio
                  analysis is that it highlights the major reason for
                  profitability and also increases the science of the company
                  which in return helps in the determination of the net
                  financial resources that need to be allocated to the firm
                  efficiency to avoid all the unnecessary expenses.

                  The historical background says that ratio analysis came into
                  existence years ago when there was a need for the analysis of
                  standard financial statement derogation. The power of the
                  financial institutions and the shifting of the managers to the
                  professional managers helped in developing an all-over
                  approach to profitability that would be the main focus in
                  improving the profitability of the business (Michaelson et al.
                  2016). Late back in the nineteenth century, the study ensured
                  in the rapid extensions that were considered to be the first
                  catalyst in the development of the normal comparison which was
                  to be done between the current assets and the current
                  liabilities in relation to the diversified application of the
                  ratio analysis. As the theory goes, the current ratio is
                  considered to be the most important and significant ratio as
                  compared to the other available ratios. The deployment in the
                  relationship with the other entities also depends on the ratio
                  analysis that serves as the main strategy in the complete
                  model-based function which can also analyze the working of the
                  company which also determines the financial growth that is
                  determined (Mammadova and Jabrayilova, 2018). There are
                  different critics who say that the interpretations depend on
                  the working and the performance management of the company that
                  also is the major source of manipulation of information.

                  Ratios are essential to profit tools that are used in

                  plans that can improve the profitability and the liquidity of
                  the financial statements (Han et al. 2020). Ratios also help
                  in the determination of certain predictions that can also be
                  used to compare the financial figures of the company and thus
                  it can also help in adjusting the business accordingly that
