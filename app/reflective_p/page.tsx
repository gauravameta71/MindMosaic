                  Introduction
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  In the modern world the way in which business organisations
                  and entities undertake their business operations has changed
                  considerably in comparison to five years before. The modern
                  business companies tend to rely more heavily on its employees
                  despite a significant portion of the production line being
                  automated. Today, business entities try to provide more
                  training and workshop programs for its employees to develop
                  their skills and knowledge base. However, such programs can
                  only benefit for the organisation at the best possible levels
                  if the employees conceive the importance of such programs and
                  try to enhance their personal skills. One of the best ways to
                  achieve higher efficiency is through self-reflection that
                  helps the employees to identify the areas they need to work on
                  (Knapp, Gottlieb & Handelsman, 2017). The following essay will
                  be my understanding of why self-reflection is important and
                  how it can provide better support for my personal development
                  in the professional sector.

                <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black">Discussion</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  Raison d’etre and the implication of professional reflective
                  practice: The term “raison d’etre refers to the purpose of a
                  person’s existence. This helps a person to understand what she
                  is supposed to do. I think understanding the implications of
                  one’s existence is vital to have a true purpose in life, which
                  can often be a strong motivation to function or undertake
                  daily responsibilities with enthusiasm (Dunning, Heath & Suls,
                  2018). For me it is very important to know what I am supposed
                  to do so that I can plan y course of action efficiently and
                  can decide on the activities and operations that are essential
                  to complete the objectives with precision. Raison d’etre can
                  also be considered to as the justification for existence which
                  to me is considered as a situation where a person should
                  provide arguments in favour of her or his existence. I think
                  in the professional sector this factor is even more complex
                  than how it may seem and should be given ample focus by the
                  individual for professional development. <br />
                  <br /> I think professional reflective practice should be
                  given more attention in the professional field just like any
                  other field of work. I think that it is almost impossible for
                  any person to have a complete knowledge or understanding of
                  every single aspect of their professional area. Despite the
                  many training programs and workshops undertaken by business
                  organisations having an all-around knowledge is still rare for
                  an industry (Rosen, McCall & Goodkind, 2017). An employee
                  should identify this lack of knowledge as an area of potential
                  development of the professional skills. To do this, I think it
                  is very important to make sure that employees use reflective
                  practices to identify their drawback areas and such practices
                  can also help me to work in a better environment. For example
                  my professional reflection helped me to analyse my conditions
                  in Romania and helped me to understand how dealing with rude
                  people was making my mental wellbeing stressful in my previous
                  work space. I think professional reflection not only helps the
                  employees to develop their skills but also helps them to be in
                  an environment where they can address various issues to
                  maximise their work efficiency. Using professional reflective
                  practice in professional environment: In a professional
                  environment, I think, it is important for an employee to
                  evaluate her or his own efficiency to understand whether he or
                  she is able to meet the organisational criteria and meet his
                  responsibilities with proper tools and skills. The skill sets
                  required of an employee varies significantly based on the
                  nature and type of the business conducted by the organisation
                  or company (Chow & Luzzeri, 2019). <br /> <br /> This makes
                  reflective practices even more important to identify the
                  drawbacks and strengths in the context of the industry
                  requirements. For me I work in a sector which requires me to
                  interact with the customers on a daily basis and help them to
                  resolve the various issue they are facing as a member of the
                  community and the society. Hence, for me using reflective
                  tools and practices is very important to me that can help me
                  to develop my communication skills further. This in turn can
                  help me to understand my customers’ requirements in better
                  ways and can also ensure that I can provide better assistance
                  to them and benefit them. My professional environment is
                  dynamic and requires me to undertake many different
                  responsibilities based on the necessities of the customers. In
                  many cases I may have to deal with a situation or issue that I
                  may not have encountered before. Thus, for me to be open to
                  different problem solving abilities is a must in my work
                  environment is important which I can achieve by reflecting on
                  my activities as the part of the industry and organisation
                  (Gilliam et al., 2019). <br />
                  <br /> This helps me to evaluate my abilities by putting them
                  at the test in the work environment which in turn can benefit
                  me by identifying my drawbacks and an employee of the sector.
                  Purpose of reflective practice in achieving career objectives:
                  For my professional sector, the objectives are often versatile
                  and dynamic in nature which changes in accordance to the
                  nature of the requirements of the customers. My nature of work
                  requires me to interact with many customers face-to-face to
                  solve their problems and increase the value of their purchase
                  of the product or services. Thus, in such a dynamic work
                  environment, achieving the goals and objectives may be
                  challenging which will also make the attainment of the career
                  goals to become difficult. I think reflective practices in the
                  workplace can be of great help for me to correctly undertake
                  my roles as an employee of the sector (Ardelt & Grunwald,
                  2018). I also wish to progress in my professional career to
                  become a public services officer in the future. As a student
                  of this industry I must be able to fulfil the requirements of
                  my customers. This factor can be achieved with better
                  self-reflective practices so that my understanding of the
                  customers can be increased. I also want to work in a position
                  that would allow me to benefit more people with my expertise
                  and services, which makes it essential for me to constantly
                  reflect on my functions, activities and associate the same
                  with my job requirements to understand how much I have been
                  able to achieve or the efficiency of my functions. This can
                  help me to analyse the chain of events and be able to come up
                  with an alternate method that could be used to solve the issue
                  faster. Such reflection can help to develop my skills and
                  increase my efficiency significantly. My workplace provides me
                  with the opportunity to provide my assistance and support that
                  can benefit the customers by generating and adding maximum
                  value to the products or services that they purchased. As a
                  student I already understand that my area of work can affect
                  many people at the same time, which makes it important for me
                  to be able to identify the best possible solution to an issue
                  as early as possible so that I can minimise the response time
                  and provide maximum benefits. Models of reflection and how can
                  it help my personal and professional development: There are
                  various reflective models that can be used by me to emphasise
                  on the need for developing my skills using self-reflective
                  practices. These models are elaborated below: Gibb’s
                  reflective model: In this model, the necessities of
                  self-reflective practices are elaborated and how the same can
                  help an employee to become better. The Reflective Cycle, as
                  elaborated by Graham Gibbs says that an employee has the
                  opportunity to learn more regarding the activities he or she
                  experiences regularly.
                  <br /> <br /> Thus, in a changing environment reflecting on
                  the experiences can help an employee to understand better
                  regarding what she or he did to meet the responsibilities and
                  how it could be made more efficient by adopting a new method
                  in future instead of the one applied already. The cycle is
                  divided into five phases and can be used through a
                  mentor-mentee scenario (Sekarwinahyu et al., 2019). The mentor
                  can ask the employee to define a situation and then come up
                  with viable solutions. For my case the scenario can be done by
                  myself so that a self-reflective condition can be achieved. I
                  can use this model extensively to evaluate a scenario and then
                  go through the options that I have to tackle the issue so that
                  the best solution can be identified based on the unique
                  criteria of the situation. Schon model: This is another model
                  that can be of great help for my professional career <br />{" "}
                  <br />
                  This model allows for flexibility within the project
                  management process based on the condition at any given point.
                  I think I can use this model to both reflect on my experience
                  while undertaking a project and also be able to reflect on a
                  completed project to identify the mistakes and benefits at
                  each step (Gordon, 2017). This can help me to compare and
                  contrast between two scenarios and find a more efficient
                  alternative in the future.

                  From the above discussion regarding self reflective practices
                  in the workplace, it can be concluded that I understand the
                  necessity of reflection at work and also fathom how such
                  practices can benefit my career in the future in the domain of
                  public services. I will be using self-reflection as a way to
                  make sure to constantly evaluate my performance for better
                  efficiency.
