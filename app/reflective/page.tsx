                  In this report, I discussed a project and the project has
                  recently faced some issues due to technical as well as
                  interpersonal issues. The project mainly faces issues
                  regarding our communication gap and the reasons are also I
                  described in this report clearly as well as I will discuss the
                  way that we resolve all the existing issues of this project
                  and enhance the performance of this project.

                  as a team member in a project and my main discussion is, how I
                  achieve my goal to improve or develop this project. Although
                  there are a lot of issues present in this project and as a

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  Currently, I am a member of a project and this project is now
                  facing some issues such as technical issues, and interpersonal
                  issues that are massively affecting the performance of this
                  project (Antony and Gupta, 2018). As a team member I need to
                  resolve all the issues which are existing in this project thus
                  I need to build a team communication that can help to resolve
                  all the issues in this project. Currently, the project is
                  facing some technical issues such as low speed of progress, IT
                  infrastructure changes, large learning curves, Lack of clear
                  communication with multiple suppliers and vendors, unable to
                  fill client’s requirements, and so on. Thus, my team members
                  and I are also responsible for these issues thus we together
                  need to resolve all of these issues by taking some approaches.{" "}
                  <br />
                  Apart from this some interpersonal issues also exist in this
                  project and the main interpersonal issue is the communication
                  issue or communication gap between the team members, clients,
                  and members. Due to the huge communication gap, my teammates
                  are unable to resolve all the existing issues, for this
                  reason, the quality of this project are now decreasing
                  (Bundschuh, 2018). Mainly this project is suffering from
                  stakeholders’ or clients’ fulfillment problems. The clients
                  are not happy with the performance of the teammates including
                  me, basically, the client’s requirements are not fulfilled due
                  to the huge communication gap between us. Thus, we need to
                  resolve it soon to successfully complete this project.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  I have discussed all the current issues in the previous
                  paragraph and the issues need to be resolved otherwise it is
                  hugely impacted the project performance. I need to follow some
                  approaches or strategies to resolve all the existing issues in
                  this project. The strategies are given below.
                </p><br />
                <p className="text-black font-semibold">
                  Project management techniques
                </p> <br />

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  Firstly, the project management should take some techniques to
                  resolve the existing issues in this project and as team
                  members; we need to follow their techniques to resolve the
                  issues (Kim, 2020). The management can implement WBS, Gantt
                  chart, and critical path method to resolve the gap in this
                  project.
                </p> <br />

                <p className="text-black font-semibold">Teamwork</p><br />
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  After that the main step that we need to follow is teamwork,
                  teamwork always plays an important role to enhance the
                  standard and performance of a project. Here, we need to focus
                  on teamwork because all the existing issues occur due to the
                  lack of teamwork. For this reason, we need to do teamwork to
                  resolve all the issues by taking our own approaches and it
                  will also help the project to improve in the upcoming days
                  (Berman et al., 2018). Teamwork includes work between the team
                  members and the clients and we need to do teamwork to overcome
                  issues.

                <p className="text-black font-semibold">Communication</p><br />
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  Apart from teamwork, team communication is also an important
                  factor that can help to increase the performance of this
                  project. All the issues of this project occurred due to the
                  low communication between us and clients as well as mentors.
                  For this reason, we need to maintain good and effective
                  communication between us and clients as well as mentors. Well,
                  communication helps us to identify all the issues that are
                  present in this project, and after finding the issues we can
                  easily resolve all the issues by communicating with each other
                  (Kammel, 2020). Apart from this, we need to establish good
                  communication with the clients to meet their wants and
                  requirements that will definitely help us to mitigate all the
                  issues in the upcoming days of this project.

                <p className="text-black font-semibold">Pair programming</p><br />
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  Pair programming is effective software in agile software
                  development techniques where 2 programmers work together in a
                  workplace. Here we need to implement this kind of software to
                  enhance the performance of this project. This software can
                  easily figure out the existing and upcoming issues of this
                  project and it can deliver the best solution to mitigate the
                  upcoming risks of this project to successfully complete this
                  project.

                  From this study, I have gained my overall experience as well
                  as I learned a lot of new things that enhance my learning
                  area. Here I learned the ways to develop this project to
                  mitigate all the existing issues that are impacted on the
                  performance of this project. From this report, I learn that
                  this project faces a lot of issues such as technical and
                  interpersonal issues. In this project, the main issue occurs
                  due to the communication gap between my teammates with the
                  clients, and mentors. From this report, I learned that there
                  are some issues regarding teamwork (Foley et al., 2020). Due
                  to the teamwork issue, this project is currently facing, I
                  learned how to resolve all of these issues. <br /> There are
                  some strategies that I need to implement to resolve the
                  existing issues in this project. Currently, the project is
                  facing some technical issues such as low speed of progress, IT

                  communication with multiple suppliers and vendors, unable to
                  fill client’s requirements, and so on. The key steps or
                  strategies are teamwork, team communication, pair programming,
                  project management techniques, and so on. Thus, this study
                  helps me to improve my knowledge and experience that help me
                  overcome all the project-related issues in my future.
